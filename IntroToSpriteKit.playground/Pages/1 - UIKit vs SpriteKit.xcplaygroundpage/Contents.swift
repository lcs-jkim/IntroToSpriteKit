 ## UIKit vs. SpriteKit
 
 UIKit is a *framework* (a collection of functionality) that Apple provides to software developers so that they can author iOS apps more easily.
 
 UIKit offers classes such as UITextField, UIButton, and UILabel, which we've made use of in prior tasks.  UIKit also offers more advanced classes like UITableView â€“ commonly used in iOS apps. Some examples:

 [SpriteKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit) is another framework that Apple provides to software developers so that they can more easily author a different type of app: an animation, or a game.
